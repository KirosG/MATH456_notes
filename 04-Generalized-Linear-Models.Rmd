One of the primary assumptions with linear regression, is that the error terms have a specific distribution. Namely: 

$$ \epsilon_{i} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^{2}) \qquad i=1, \ldots, n, \quad \mbox{and } \epsilon_{i} \perp \epsilon_{j}, i \neq j $$

When your outcome variable $y$ is non-continuous/non-normal, the above assumption fails dramatically. 

Generalized Linear Models (GLM) allows for different data type outcomes by allowing the linear portion of the model ($\mathbf{X}\beta$) to be related to the outcome variable $y$ using a _link_ function, that allows the magnitude of the variance of the errors ($\sigma$) to be related to the predicted values themselves. 

There are three overarching types of non-continuous outcomes that can be modeled with GLM's. 

* Binary data: Logistic or Probit regression
* Multinomial/categorical data: Multinomial or Ordinal Logistic regression. 
* Count data: Poisson regression

At this time these notes goes into depth for Logistic regression only, due to its commonplace in data analysis tools. 


## Fitting GLMs in R

Generalized linear regression models can be fit in R using the `glm()` function. This function can fit an entire _family_ of distributions and can be thought of as $E(Y|X) = C(X)$ where $C$ is the **link** function that relates $Y$ to $X$.

* Linear regression: C = Identity function (no change)
* Logistic regression: C = logit function
* Poisson regression: C = log function

The general syntax is similar to `lm()`, with the additional required `family=` argument. See `?family` for a list of options. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
glm(y ~ x1 + x2 + x3, data=DATA, family="binomial")
```

## Binary Data

Goals: 

* Assess the impact selected covariates have on the probability of an outcome occurring. 
* Predict the likelihood / chance / probability of an event occurring given a certain covariate pattern.  

Binary data can be fit using a _Logistic Model_ or a _Probit Model_.


Consider an outcome variable $Y$ with two levels: Y = 1 if event, = 0 if no event. 

Let $p_{i} = P(y_{i}=1)$. 

The logistic model relates the probability of an event based on a linear combination of X's. 

$$
log\left(
\frac{p_{i}}{1-p_{i}}
\right) = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x_{1i} + \beta_{2}x_{2i} + \ldots + \beta_{p}x_{pi}
$$

Since the _odds_ are defined as the probability an event occurs divided by the  probability it does not occur: $(p/(1-p))$, the function $log\left(\frac{p_{i}}{1-p_{i}}\right)$ is also known as the _log odds_, or more commonly called the **_logit_**. This is the _link_ function for the logistic regression model. 

```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=3, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
p <- seq(0, 1, by=.01)
logit.p <- log(p/(1-p))
qplot(logit.p, p, geom="line", xlab = "logit(p)", main="The logit transformation")
```

This in essence takes a binary outcome 0/1 variable, turns it into a continuous probability (which only has a range from 0 to 1) Then the logit(p) has a continuous distribution ranging from $-\infty$ to $\infty$, which is the same form as a Multiple Linear Regression (continuous outcome modeled on a set of covariates)

Back solving the logistic model for $p_{i} = e^{\beta X} / (1+e^{\beta X})$ gives us the probability of an event. 

$$
p_{i} = \frac{e^{\beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x_{1i} + \beta_{2}x_{2i} + \ldots + \beta_{p}x_{pi}}}
{1 + e^{\beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x_{1i} + \beta_{2}x_{2i} + \ldots + \beta_{p}x_{pi}}}
$$

```{block2,  type='rmdtip'}
The probit function uses the inverse CDF for the normal distribution as the link function. 
```


### Example: The effect of gender on Depression

Is gender associated with depression? Read in the `depression` data and recode sex to be an indicator of being male. 
```{r}
depress <- read.delim("https://norcalbiostat.netlify.com/data/depress_081217.txt")
names(depress) <- tolower(names(depress)) # make all variable names lower case. 
```

* Binary outcome variable: Symptoms of Depression (`cases`)
* Binary predictor variable: Gender (`sex`) as an indicator of being female

The outcome $y$ is a 0/1 Bernoulli random variable. The sum of a vector of Bernoulli's ($\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_{i}$) has a Binomial distribution. When we specify that `family = "binomial"` the `glm()` function auto-assigns "logit" link function. 

```{r}
dep_sex_model <- glm(cases ~ sex, data=depress, family="binomial")
summary(dep_sex_model)
```

We exponentiate the coefficients to back transform the $\beta$ estimates into Odds Ratios
```{r}
exp(coef(dep_sex_model))
```

Females have 2.8 times the odds of showing signs of depression compared to males. 

**Confidence Intervals**
The OR is **not** a linear function of the $x's$, but $\beta$ is. This means that a CI for the OR is created by calculating a CI for $\beta$, and then exponentiating the endpoints. A 95% CI for the OR can be calculated as: 

$$e^{\hat{\beta} \pm 1.96 SE_{\beta}} $$

```{r}
exp(confint(dep_sex_model))
```

### Multiple Logistic Regression 
Just like multiple linear regression, additional predictors are simply included in the model using a `+` symbol. 
```{r}
mvmodel <- glm(cases ~ age + income + sex, data=depress, family="binomial")
summary(mvmodel)
```

* The sign of the $\beta$ coefficients can be interpreted in the same manner as with linear regression. 
* The odds of being depressed are less if the respondent has a higher income and is older, and higher if the respondent is female. 

### Interpretation

* The OR provides a directly understandable statistic for the relationship between $y$ and a specific $x$ given all other $x$'s in the model are fixed. 
* For a continuous variable X with slope coefficient $\beta$, the quantity $e^{b}$ is interpreted as the ratio of the odds for a person with value (X+1) relative to the odds for a person with value X. 
* $exp(kb)$ is the incremental odds ratio corresponding to an increase of $k$ units in the variable X, assuming that the values of all other X variables remain unchanged. 

**Where does $OR = e^{\beta}$ come from?**

The full model is: 
$$log(odds) = -0.676 - 0.02096*age - .03656*income + 0.92945*gender$$

We want to calculate the Odds Ratio of depression for women compared to men. 
$$ OR = \frac{Odds (Y=1|F)}{Odds (Y=1|M)} $$

Write out the equations for men and women separately. 
$$ = \frac{e^{-0.676 - 0.02096*age - .03656*income + 0.92945(1)}}
          {e^{-0.676 - 0.02096*age - .03656*income + 0.92945(0)}}$$

Applying rules of exponents to simplify.
$$ = \frac{e^{-0.676}e^{- 0.02096*age}e^{- .03656*income}e^{0.92945(1)}}
          {e^{-0.676}e^{- 0.02096*age}e^{- .03656*income}e^{0.92945(0)}}$$

$$ = \frac{e^{0.92945(1)}}
          {e^{0.92945(0)}}$$

$$ = e^{0.92945} $$

```{r}
exp(.92945)
exp(coef(mvmodel)[4])
```

The odds of a female being depressed are 2.53 times greater than the odds for Males after adjusting for the linear effects of age and income (p=.016). 


#### Effect of a k unit change
Sometimes a 1 unit change in a continuous variable is not meaningful. 

```{r}
exp(coef(mvmodel))
exp(confint(mvmodel))
```

* The Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) for increase of 1 year of age is 0.98 (95%CI .96, 1.0)
* How about a 10 year increase in age? $e^{10*\beta_{age}} = e^{-.21} = .81$

```{r}
exp(10*coef(mvmodel)[2])
```
with a confidence interval of
```{r}
round(exp(10*confint(mvmodel)[2,]),3)
```

Controlling for gender and income, an individual has 0.81 (95% CI 0.68, 0.97) times the odds of being depressed compared to someone who is 10 years younger than them. 

##### Example: The relationship between income, employment status and depression. 

Here I create the binary indicators of lowincome and underemployed as described in the textbook. In each case I ensure that missing data is retained.  
```{r}
depress$lowincome <- ifelse(depress$income < 10, 1, 0)
depress$lowincome <- ifelse(is.na(depress$income), NA, depress$lowincome)

depress$underemployed <- ifelse(depress$employ %in% c(2,3), 1, 0 )
depress$underemployed <- ifelse(is.na(depress$employ) | depress$employ==7, NA, depress$underemployed)
table(depress$underemployed, depress$employ, useNA="always")
```

The **Main Effects** model assumes that the effect of income on depression is independent of employment status, and the effect of employment status on depression is independent of income. 

```{r}
me_model <- glm(cases ~ lowincome + underemployed, data=depress, family="binomial")
summary(me_model)
```

To formally test whether an interaction term is necessary, we add the interaction term into the model and assess whether the coefficient for the interaction term is significantly different from zero. 
```{r}
summary(glm(cases ~ lowincome + underemployed + lowincome*underemployed, data=depress, family="binomial"))
```

### Classification

* Sometimes Odds Ratios can be difficult to interpret or understand. 
* Sometimes you just want to report the probability of the event occuring. 
* Or sometimes you want to predict whether or not a new individual is going to have the event. 

For all of these, we need to calculate $p_{i} = P(y_{i}=1)$, the probability of the event. 


For the main effects model of depression on age, income and gender the predicted probability of depression is: 
$$
P(depressed) = \frac{e^{-0.676 - 0.02096*age - .03656*income + 0.92945*gender}}
{1 + e^{-0.676 - 0.02096*age - .03656*income + 0.92945*gender}}
$$

Let's compare the probability of being depressed for males and females separately, while holding age and income constant at their average value. 

```{r, echo=-1}
library(dplyr)
depress %>% summarize(age=mean(age), income=mean(income))
```

Plug the coefficient estimates and the values of the variables into the equation and calculate. 
$$
P(depressed|Female) = \frac{e^{-0.676 - 0.02096(44.4) - .03656(20.6) + 0.92945(1)}}
{1 + e^{-0.676 - 0.02096(44.4) - .03656(20.6) + 0.92945(1)}}
$$

```{r}
XB.f <- -0.676 - 0.02096*(44.4) - .03656*(20.6) + 0.92945
exp(XB.f) / (1+exp(XB.f))
```
$$
P(depressed|Male) = \frac{e^{-0.676 - 0.02096(44.4) - .03656(20.6) + 0.92945(0)}}
{1 + e^{-0.676 - 0.02096(44.4) - .03656(20.6) + 0.92945(0)}}
$$
```{r}
XB.m <- -0.676 - 0.02096*(44.4) - .03656*(20.6)
exp(XB.m) / (1+exp(XB.m))
```

The probability for a 44.4 year old female who makes $20.6k annual income has a 0.19 probability of being depressed. The probability of depression for a male of equal age and income is 0.86. 

### Predictions using R

So what if you want to get the model predicted probability of the event for all individuals in the data set? There's no way i'm doing that calculation for every person in the data set. 

Using the main effects model from above, stored in the object `mvmodel`, we can call the `predict()` command to generate a vector of predictions for each row used in the model. 

```{block2,  type='rmdcaution'}
Any row with missing data on any variable used in the model will NOT get a predicted value.
```


The `predict` function can calculate predictions for any GLM. The model object `mvmodel` stores the information that it was a logistic regression. 
```{r}
model.pred.prob <- predict(mvmodel, type='response')
head(model.pred.prob)
```


#### Distribution of Predictions
How well does our model do to predict depression? 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
plot.mpp <- data.frame(prediction = model.pred.prob, 
                       truth = factor(mvmodel$y, labels=c("Not Depressed", "Depressed")))

ggplot(plot.mpp, aes(x=truth, y=prediction, fill=truth)) + 
      geom_jitter(width=.2) + geom_violin(alpha=.4) + theme_bw()
```

![](images/q.png) What things can you infer from this plot?

![](images/q.png) What would happen if we used a cutoff value of 0.5? What about 0.2? 

#### Moving the cutoff value

* So how do we balance the true postives and true negatives? 
* We can create a Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to help find that sweet spot. 
* We'll use the [[ROCR]](https://rocr.bioinf.mpi-sb.mpg.de/) package. It only takes 3 commands: 
    - calculate `prediction` using the model
    - calculate the model `performance` on both true positive rate and true negative rate for a whole range of cutoff values. 
    - `plot` the curve. 
        - The `colorize` option colors the curve according to the probability cutoff point. 

```{r}
library(ROCR)
pr <- prediction(model.pred.prob, mvmodel$y)
perf <- performance(pr, measure="tpr", x.measure="fpr")
plot(perf, colorize=TRUE, lwd=3, print.cutoffs.at=c(seq(0,1,by=0.1)))
abline(a=0, b=1, lty=2)
```

ROC curves: 

* Show tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity 
* Can also be used for model comparison: http://yaojenkuo.io/diamondsROC.html
* can give you a measure of overall model accuracy by calculating the area under the curve (auc). 

```{r}
auc <- performance(pr, 'auc')
auc@y.values
```

### Model Performance

* Say we decide that a value of 0.15 is our optimal cutoff value. 
* We can use this probability to classify each row into groups. 
    - The assigned class values must match the data type and levels of the true value.
    - It also has to be in the same order, so the `0` group needs to come first. 
* Then we calculate a [[ConfusionMatrix]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix) using the similiarily named function from the `caret` package. 

```{r}
library(caret)

plot.mpp$pred.class <- ifelse(plot.mpp$prediction <0.15, 0,1)
plot.mpp$pred.class <- factor(plot.mpp$pred.class, labels=c("Not Depressed", "Depressed"))

confusionMatrix(plot.mpp$pred.class, plot.mpp$truth, positive="Depressed")
```

* Sensitivity: P(True + |Predicted +)
* Specificity: P(True - |Predicted -)
* Accuracy: $n_{11} + n_{22} / N$ (proportion of entries on main diagonal)
* Balanced Accuracy: [$(n_{11}/n_{.1}) + (n_{22}/n_{.2})$]/2 
* False Positive Rate: P(Predicted + | True -)
