# (PART) Multi-level Modeling {-}


# Introduction

The assumption of independence between observations is often violated $Cor(\epsilon_i, \epsilon_j)\neq 0, \forall i\neq j$

* Sampling students within schools. (Within school correlation)
* Repeatedely measuring the same tree in different places. (Within-subject correlation)
* Repeatedly measuring the same tree over time. (Temporal correlation)
* Poverty measurements from different, but neighboring, counties. (Spatial correlation)

When data are _clustered_, we need to adjust the correlation.
